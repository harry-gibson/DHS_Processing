    "This file contains code for producing custom output \"recode\" tables from DHS tables that have first been processed out into individual files for each survey and table (record type). \n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially it provides a means of \"joining\" tables that are stored in flat CSV files, just like executing a join query on data held in a DB. The joining is done by loading each of the input tables to an in-memory SQLite database, building the output table there, and dumping the output table back to a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for actually constructing the SQL that builds the in-memory database, and performs the joins, is implemented in an external module that should be in the same directory as this notebook. This notebook just contains the necessary code to read the input requirements and data, and write the output files.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was developed by Harry Gibson for extracting information (potentially) related to Under 5 Mortality for Donal Bisanzio. However it should be applicable for creating any \"flat\" joined output tables from DHS data that has been parsed into separate tables from the CSPro format."
